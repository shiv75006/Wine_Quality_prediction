## Introduction

The Wine Quality Prediction System aims to predict the quality of wines based on input features such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, and more. The project demonstrates the use of the Random Forest algorithm, a popular machine learning technique for classification tasks, to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features

- Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for wine quality prediction.
- Preprocessing of data for model training.
- Provides an interface to input wine characteristics and get quality predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various attributes of wines and their corresponding quality ratings.

## Model

The Random Forest algorithm is employed to predict wine quality. The model is trained on the dataset and then used to predict the quality of wines based on their features.

## Results

The project achieves accurate wine quality predictions using the Random Forest algorithm. The accuracy and performance metrics can be explored in the project's code and documentation.
